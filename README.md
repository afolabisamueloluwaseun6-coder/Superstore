## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an interactive sales dashboard built for a global superstore, analyzing sales data from 2016â€“2019. Using Microsoft Excel, I transformed approximately 9,600 rows of transaction data into actionable insights, uncovering trends in customer segments, regional performance, and shipping methods. The dashboard empowers stakeholders with data-driven decision-making to optimize sales and profitability.

## Problem Statement
How can a global superstore optimize sales and profitability across regions, customer segments, and shipping methods?

## Objectives
- Analyze four years of sales data to identify key trends.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to enhance strategic decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Source**: Public dataset with 9,600 rows and 15 columns (e.g., Order ID, Region, Product Category, Ship Mode, Profit).
- **Visualizations**: Bar charts (sales by year), pie charts (profit by segment), line graphs (sales trends), and interactive slicers.
- **Insights**: Highlights Consumer segment (50% of sales), top cities (New York, California), and peak sales in 2018.

## Tools
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation.
- **PivotTables & Slicers**: Enabled interactive data exploration.

## Observations
- The Consumer segment accounts for 50% of total sales.
- New York and California lead in city sales performance.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on the Consumer segment.
- Expand presence in top cities like New York.
- Optimize Standard Class shipping logistics.
- Replicate 2018 strategies for future growth.
